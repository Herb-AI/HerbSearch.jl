Finds all the fragments from the provided `program`. The result is a set of the distinct fragments, generated recursively by going over all children.
A fragment is any complete subprogram of the original program.

- `grammar`: The grammar rules of the program.

Updates the remembered programs by including `new_program` if it is simpler than all remembered programs that pass the same subset of tests, 
    and there is no simpler program passing a superset of the tests. It also removes any "worse" programs from the dictionary.

# Arguments
- `old_remembered`: The previously remembered programs, represented as a dictionary mapping `passed_tests` to (program's tree, the tree's `node_count`, `program_length`).
- `passing_tests`: A BitVector representing the passing test set for the new program.
- `new_program`: The new program to be considered for addition to the `old_remembered` dictionary.
- `new_program_expr`: The expression of the new program, used to calculate its length. If `nothing`, the length is set to 0.
- `fragments`: A set of the fragments mined from the `old_remembered` dictionary.
- `grammar`: The grammar rules of the program.

# Returns
The newly mined fragments from the updated remembered programs, and a flag to indicate if the new program was added to the dictionary.
