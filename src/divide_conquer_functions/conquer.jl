"""
	$(TYPEDSIGNATURES)

Takes in the problems with the found solutions and combines them into a global solution program 
by combining them into a decision tree.

 # Arguments
- `problems_to_solutions::Dict{Problem, Vector{RuleNode}}`: A dictionary mapping problems to their corresponding solution programs.
- `grammar::AbstractGrammar`: The grammar used to generate and evaluate programs.
- `n_predicates::Int`: The number of predicates generated to learn the decision tree.
- `sym_bool::Symbol`: The symbol representing boolean conditions in the grammar.
- `sym_start::Symbol`: The starting symbol of the grammar.
- `sym_constraint::Symbol`: The symbol used to constrain grammar when generating predicates.
- `symboltable::SymbolTable`: The symbol table used for evaluating expressions.

# Description
Combines the progams that solve the sub-problems into a decision tree. To learn the decision tree, labels and features are required.
The solutions to the problems are used as labels. Predicates from the grammar serve as coniditional statements to combine the programs 
in the decision tree. For this, features are obtained by evaluating the inputs of the examples on the predicates. 

# Returns

The final program constructed from the solutions to the subproblems.
