Takes in the problems with the found solutions and combines them into a global solution program 
by combining them into a decision tree.

 # Arguments
- `problems_to_solutions`: A dictionary mapping problems to the index of their corresponding solution program in `solutions`.
- `solutions`: A vector containing the solutions (`RuleNode`) to the problems
- `grammar`: The grammar used to generate and evaluate programs.
- `n_predicates`: The number of predicates generated to learn the decision tree.
- `sym_bool`: The symbol representing boolean conditions in the grammar.
- `sym_start`: The starting symbol of the grammar.
- `sym_constraint`: The symbol used to constrain grammar when generating predicates.
- `symboltable`: The symbol table used for evaluating expressions.

# Description
Combines the progams that solve the sub-problems into a decision tree. To learn the decision tree, labels and features are required.
The solutions to the problems are used as labels. Predicates from the grammar serve as coniditional statements to combine the programs 
in the decision tree. For this, features are obtained by evaluating the inputs of the examples on the predicates. 

# Returns

A `RuleNode` representing the final program constructed from the solutions to the subproblems.

Construct the final program by converting a decision tree into a RuleNode.

# Arguments
- `node}`: The current node in the decision tree. Can be either
  an internal node or a leaf node.
- `idx_ifelse`: Index of the if-else rule in the grammar.
- `labels_to_programs`: Dictionary that maps a label to the corresponding subprogram.
- `predicates`: Vector of predicates used for feature tests in the decision tree.

# Description
Recursively traverses a decision tree and constructs an equivalent `RuleNode`.
For each internal node in the decision tree, the function creates a conditional `RuleNode` using the node's
feature. When a leaf node is reached, it returns the program corresponding to the 
leaf node's label from `labels_to_programs`. 

# Returns
- `RuleNode`: The final program derived from the decision tree. It combines solutions to sub-problems using conditional statements
and features derived from the `predicates`.
