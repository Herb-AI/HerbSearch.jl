### Todo now
- make sure depth of the two algorithms matches - either hardcode or not
- make sure meta search can run on multiple problems
- define math problems or just make it work with the ones we have
- push changes
 




Todo

### Nice to have:
- way to configure the meta grammar from the configuration file. How to bake a constant when creating a grammar?


### Testing:
- how to mock functions that are "baked" into the grammar?
- 




### Bugs
- Have some good logging to see what the meta search is doing.
- Make sure documentation is up to date and that the code is clean
- Test using mocking

### Performance:
- Add more threads
